    "title": "Becoming Responsible for CSS",
    "description": "<p>People should feel a sense of ownership and responsibility for the tools they use. I've become responsible for the future of CSS by becoming co-chair of the working group. But everyone who uses CSS can help by communicating what they're doing, shouting when things go wrong, and scripting better solutions. I'll talk about how people can engage in standards discussions, log bugs and write testcases, and how the Houdini task force will let more people write better code for styling.</p>"
